        <h1>OUR IMPACT</h1>
        <p>As the world’s leading conservation organization, 
            <b>Nature for Future</b> works in nearly 100 countries to tackle the most pressing
             issues at the intersection of nature, people, and climate. We collaborate with local
              communities to conserve the natural resources we all depend on and build a future in which
               people and nature thrive. Together with partners at all levels, we transform markets and
                policies toward sustainability, tackle the threats driving the climate crisis,
             and protect and restore wildlife and their habitats.</p>

                WHY CONNECTIVITY MATTERS TO WILDLIFE—AND PEOPLE

        <h1>Ecological Connectivity</h1>
        <p><b>What is ecological connectivity?</b><br>
            Ecological connectivity is the ability for animals on land or in water to move
             freely from place to place. Movement allows them to find food, breed, and establish 
             new home territories. The unimpeded movement of animals and the flow of natural processes
              sustain life on Earth.<br><br><br>
            
            <b>Why is connectivity important?</b><br>
            We’ve learned that protected areas in isolation aren’t enough.
             When protected areas are connected, they help maintain the natural processes that support clean air, rich soil, and freshwater on which we all rely. Habitats that allow for this unobstructed movement have what we call ‘high connectivity,’ meaning that all living things can freely move and access the resources they need to thrive. If connectivity is lost, landscapes, river systems, and seascapes become fragmented, the movement of wildlife becomes limited
             or ceases, and ecological systems can begin to break down..</p>

                Turning the tide on plastic waste management

        <h1>Waste Management</h1>
        <p>It's hard to imagine that every minute a dump truck worth of plastic enters our
             oceans—adding up to 11 million metric tons of plastic each year. And it's even harder
              to imagine that even though 85% of Indians are frustrated by this reality, we still 
              don't have national policies in place<br>
             to tackle the plastic waste problem choking our nation.</p>
